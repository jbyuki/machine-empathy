Machine empathy
===============

Try to guess the hidden randomly generated finite state machine by sending input and receiving output.

How to build
------------

1. Install a C++ compiler (Visual Studio, MinGW, ...)
2. Install CMake
3. Once in directory execute:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
4. Compile project

Notes
-----

Better play without writing only using head, set a randomly generated finite states machines that is not too large

This project is an attempt for people like me that have troubles understanding what they don't see. The person playing the game has to simulate in their head: to see something they don't see.
